# Nexpress
> A zero dependecy node http server and route multiplexer

Let's face it. Node.js has become the red-headed step child of the development world. With fiascos like `leftpad` and `event-stream` we kind of brought it on ourselves right? It's time to stop doing an `npm install` or a `yarn add` every time we take a new ticket. Time to stand up and fight dependency bloat in Node!
